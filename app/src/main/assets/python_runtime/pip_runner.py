# PLACEHOLDER: pip Package Manager Integration
# This file is a placeholder for pip package installation functionality
# 
# When Chaquopy is integrated, pip functionality is available through:
# 
# 1. Build-time installation (in app/build.gradle):
#    python {
#        pip {
#            install "package-name"
#        }
#    }
# 
# 2. Runtime installation (requires additional configuration):
#    - Not recommended for production apps
#    - Requires write access to Python site-packages
#    - Use build-time installation instead
# 
# For listing installed packages:
# import pkg_resources
# installed_packages = pkg_resources.working_set
# for package in installed_packages:
#     print(f"{package.key} == {package.version}")
# 
# See Chaquopy documentation for pip integration:
# https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/doc/current/android.html#pip
